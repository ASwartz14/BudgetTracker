## Installation

No installation required just visit the website. Otherwise fork the repo and use node package manager to run npm i, then npm start and open your browser to localhost:3000.

## Usage

As a busy person trying to keep track of my finances, this app allows you to deduct and deposit both on and offline.

## Contributing

I built this using UW Bootcamp's activities for reference using as much boilerplate code as I could find...specifically from activity 26 of the NoSql week I was tasked with creating the offline functionality (db.js) the frontend and backend were already developed by UW Bootcamp/Trilogy. It is opensource so please feel free to fork and develop however you'd like.
